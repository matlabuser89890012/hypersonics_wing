% Function to calculate lift based on geometry and Mach number

function lift = calc_lift(x, y, Mach)
    % Simple lift calculation (for demonstration)
    lift_coefficient = 0.04 * Mach;
    area = trapz(x, y);  % Approximate surface area using trapezoidal rule
    lift = lift_coefficient * area;
end
